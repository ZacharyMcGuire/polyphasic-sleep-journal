Waking up at 2:30am was surprisingly easy. Infact, I felt better rested than I usually do waking up at 7:30am, or 8am. I rolled out of bed and took my ADHD meds right away. I figured the Ritalin would help keep sleep at bay. I figured coffee would help, too. Even managed to get a perfect extraction, 18g in 36g out over 30 seconds - today was shaping up to be a good day.

Figured with all this extra time in my morning I'd get some billable hours in on the side-job. Added a quite productive 1.5 hours on my timesheet and decided to take some of this time to unwind too, and booted up Rimworld. Once the sun came up, and construction work began on the building across the street, I spent a little while before the first nap on a few chors.

Heading into my first nap at 7am I was starting to feel a little tired. Although mostly physical tiredness, I recall my mental capacity felt fine. I made the room as dark, and blocked out as much of the construction noise, as I could. Somehow, I managed to fall asleep almost immediately. It was a very light sleep - like I almost witnessed the entire 20 minutes. I remember dreaming very vividly, like I wasn't sure if I was actually asleep or if my mind was just visually playing out thoughts - not something that's ever really happened in my sleep before.

7:20 came around a lot slower than I expected heading into that nap, and I woke up feeling quite refreshed. A quick breakfast later I was heading into the home office to start the day-job, because of course I chose Day 1 to be on a Monday. A few quick checks of the morning reporting and I was off to the local coffee shop for 2nd coffee - was really doubting I would make it through the day, not that 2nd coffee was *unusual*.

More Ritalin at 9am, but an otherwise uneventful morning. I recall being about as productive in the mornings as I usually am - tend to find my mornings are where I get most of, and my best, work done. Delaying lunch an hour from my usual 12pm to 1pm was much harder than anything else to this point.

That 1pm nap could not have come sooner. From about 12:45pm I was starting to crash, hard. No sooner than I laid my head on the pillow and I was out. Just like before, the sleep felt very light - but this time no vivid dreaming. I did wake myself up a couple of times though, snoring. I had expected going in that I would end up sleeping the rest of the afternoon, yet somehow when 1:20pm came around and my alarm went off I found myself getting out of bed and feeling good.

Lunch, and a couple of quick chors later, I was back at work. Getting back from lunch at 2pm felt a lot nicer than the usual 1pm. Not only had I remainded productive, mostly, for the additional hour before lunch, but coming back at 2pm left only 2.5 hours in my work day. A much nicer feeling than watching the clock run down from 1pm.

What was really surprising, is how productive I was in the afternoon. Typically, I leave all my management tasks to after lunch - expecting that I won't have a lot of mental capacity left for coding. Today however, I picked back up some half-written code like I had only stopped to take a drink.

Some more meds at 3:30pm to help survive until 10pm, and before I knew it the work day was done. I had not only survived work on Day 1, but was a little more productive  than usual. Certainly, this was not out-of-the-ordinary enough to correlate entirely to the sleep schedule - not to mention being a sample size of one, but I took it as a good sign.

At this point, I got a phone call from a friend to remind me we had plans that afternoon. Oops, not only had I forgot we had plans (a very common occurance for me, ask any friend) but I had chosen Day 1 to be today. Should I really be driving? Probably not - but I figured with all the driver-safety & self-driving tech I wouldn't be at too much risk (I won't mention how many times that tech has paid for itself).

The drive there was easy enough, I wasn't feeling fatigued yet. If anything, I had more energy to focus than usual. If I'm particularly honest, micro naps are not uncommon for me whilst driving - hence my investment into the driver-safety tech. Today though, I didn't feel like the car was doing the heavy lifting - even on the drive home. Socially, I think I was my normal introverted self - nothing noteworthy in terms of mental/social focus.

Getting home at around 9:15pm I found myself wanting to take some notes on the day, to make writing this entry a little easier (shout out to my tablet for corrupting the notes). Whilst taking notes I found that I was struggling to keep it to dot-point notes; I was wanting to just write the journal - and had more than enough mental capacity to do so. Again, a sample size of one, but this was simply unheard of in my personal history - I function at the bare minimum from about 3pm onwards and this was 9:30pm!

A quick shower and self-care routine later, I found myself in bed a little early, about 9:55pm. Physically,  I was uterrly exhausted. Mentally, I was still planning out tasks and code in my head for tomorrow. I thought to myself "Oh great! Now I'll struggle to get what little sleep I'm allowing myself.", expecting that my mind would be too active to fall asleep (another very common occurance). I can only tell you that my watch says I fell asleep at 10:23pm - but I don't recall struggling at all.

For the nerds, like myself, my watch recorded the following sleep metrics:
| Sleep Stage | Duration (hours:minutes) |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Awake       | 00:19                    |
| REM         | 00:51                    |
| Light       | 02:28                    |
| Deep        | 00:35                    |

For a total of 4 hours and 13 minutes, or 3 hours and 52 minutes actually asleep.
