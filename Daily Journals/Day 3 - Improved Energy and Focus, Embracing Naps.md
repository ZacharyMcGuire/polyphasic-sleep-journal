# Early Morning Struggles and Motivation
Waking up on Day 3 was a struggle. I had to fight the will not to give up on polyphasic sleep entirely and just go back to sleep. I managed to drag myself out of bed, but initially lacked the mental capacity to accomplish much.

# Productive Morning and First Nap
After doing some more research on sleep the day before, I avoided my morning coffee ritual to see how it affected my 7am nap. After working up the motivation to *do anything* that morning, it ended up being a rather productive morning. I completed a few tasks for my side-gig and tidied up around the house..

Oddly enough, when 7am came around I wasn't very tired. But, I thought best to keep the schedule - how else will my body learn? Despite the lack of tireness I still managed to fall straight to sleep. Bit of an uneventful nap, woke up 20 minutes later and felt normal.

# Delayed Morning Coffee
Took a walk down to the coffee shop for my first coffee of the morning. Feels weird to be drinking my first coffee 5.5 hours after I've woken. If I did that on a typical sleep schedule I'm not sure I'd be awake to drink it.

# Mid Morning
The work morning was reasonably productive, maybe slightly more than usual. I postponed the tedious manual work I should have been doing in favor of a less monotonous task, which likely helped my productivity.. Unfortunately, my efforts to pawn that off on someone else don't appear to be fruitful, guess I'll pick it back up tomorrow.

Hunger also seems to have improved - despite my inability to remember to snack. Was reasonably hungry by mid day, but not enough to really distract me or affect my day too much. 

# Second Nap
Heading into the second nap I felt like I absolutely needed this one. Started to feel tired somewhere around 15 minutes prior, but I crashed *hard*. Only thing I recall about that nap was waking myself up a few times from snoring. Didn't seem to affect the quality too much, I woke up feeling great! I remember rolling out of bed thinking *"how great are naps!"*.

# Afternoon Activities and Reflections
The afternoon was spent looking after a beef brisket and a few life-admin tasks I've been putting off for the better-part of a year. I guess you could call that productive. I'm finding myself able to do a lot of these tasks I usually put off. Reflecting on that I think perhaps I don't feel like my entire day is just work. I don't feel like my only purpose is to work my day job and go back to sleep - I have time to do things throughout my day that I *choose* to do.

# Daily Ratings and Observations
* Energy was certainly better than usual, once the initial groggyness was over.
* Focus was above average too - no issue with distractions or losing train of thought.
* Mental capacity feels limitless; I don't feel like I needed to fight myself to complete tasks at all today.
* Productivity was good. The additional hours in the day alone really help with getting things done, but the efficient use of that time felt better than what is typical for me - especially in the afternoons.
