# Introduction
Day 2 of my polyphasic sleep journey. As I continue to adapt to this new sleep schedule, I faced challenges in maintaining productivity and energy levels throughout the day. I have my doubts attributing those entirely to the adaption phase, as I know my productivity can be directly related to my enjoyment of the work - and boy do I have some mundane tasks to complete this week.

# Early Morning Struggles
Day 2 almost didn't happen. I managed to turn off the alarm at 2:30am and go back to sleep, all without processing a concious thought. Somehow, I managed to realise about 5 minues later. Boy am I tired though. I laid in bed for a few minutes trying to muster the energy to get up. I knew if I laid there too much longer I'd just go back to sleep.

# Dealing with Hunger and Productivity
By about 5:30am, I was starting to feel very hungry, but less tired. I was far less productive with my time this morning and found myself doing nothing of real value.  I'm going to try and remember to snack throughout the day moving forward and see if this helps. For productivity, I have a few ideas that I'm hoping might improve my task management. Will look to implement these over the course of this week.

# Nap 1
*7am - 7:20am*
First nap went smoothly, fell straight asleep and woke up feeling well rested. However, the dreaming was *very*  vivid. Still not sure I'm enjoying this. I managed to wake up ontime, slightly before the alarm went off.

# Work: Unproductive Rabbit Holes
Work was not productive. I made a little progress on a few things, but also wasted a bunch of time going down rabbit holes. Not entirely sure I can contribute that to sleep - the work is massively boring, tedious and heavy amounts of manual effort. I'm sure I'd be just as unproductive on a typical sleep schedule.

# Nap 2
*1pm - 1:20pm*
Hunger and sleep were becoming a major problem heading into the second nap. Second nap was good and pretty uneventful. I don't recall dreaming which, after the dreams I had earlier, is a good thing. Felt like it gave me the energy to face the afternoon.

# Afternoon Focus and Productivity Issues
Productivity had not improved over the afternoon. My work day was pretty much a write-off. Hopefully I can get through this task tomorrow and move onto something worthwhile.

# Evening Reflections
Afternoon was okay, found myself hyperfocused on a few things but unfortunately nothing of any value. Wrapping up for the day I felt physically exhausted but otherwise fine. Sleep, and the comfort of my bed, are definately calling. Hopefully tomorrow is more productive.

# Sleep Ratings and Observations
- Energy was alright. I've certainly had worse energy levels on my former sleep schedule.
- Focus was all over the place, albiet not uncommon.
- Mental capacity felt reasonably normal.
- Productivity was absolute garbage. Not really due to a lack of any of the other metrics - just an extremely unproductive day. Everything else was more or less normal.
- When considering outside factors on these metrics, I recall being extremely unproductive on these same tasks last year (yay for highly-manual annual tasks).

# Core Sleep Statistics
*10pm - 2:30am*
| Sleep Stage | Duration (hours:minutes) |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Awake       | 00:14                    |
| REM         | 00:46                    |
| Light       | 02:18                    |
| Deep        | 00:40                    |

For a total of 4 hours and 8 minutes, or 3 hours and 43 minutes actually asleep.
